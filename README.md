# Implementation-of-LL1-Parser
The LL1 parser is a compiler component which breaks data into smaller elements for easy translation. The LL1 parser being implemented is a top-down parser which uses one-token look=ahead. The first L in “LL1” indicates that the input is read from left to right. The second L says that it produces a left-to-right derivation. And the 1 says that it uses one look-ahead token. To construct the Parsing table, we have implemented two functions: First(): If there is a variable, and from that variable, if we try to derive all the strings then the beginning Terminal Symbol is called the first. Follow(): It determines the Terminal Symbol which follows a variable in the process of derivation. Now, after computing the First and Follow set for each Non-Terminal symbol we have constructed the Parsing table. In the table, Rows will contain the Non-Terminals and the column will contain the Terminal Symbols. All the Null Productions of the Grammars will go under the Follow elements and the remaining productions will lie under the elements of the First set. This String parsing function takes a string as Input and outputs whether the string is accepted or rejected by the grammar
